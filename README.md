# muti-screen-preview
Type in a URL that allows itself to be embedded in iframes to preview at multiple resolutions
Limitations:
- Target Pages must use HTTPS (since the GitHub pages is HTTPS, you cannot request insecure pages from it).
- Target Pages must allow themselves to be viewed in an `iframe` from another origin. This prevents using the tool for many major sites like Google.
